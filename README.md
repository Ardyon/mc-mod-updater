# MC Mod Updater
Application that lets you update your minecraft mods in bulk. [TODO and idea's](https://trello.com/b/aAbONtbP/mcmodupdater)

## Installation
For Windows, go to the [releases](https://github.com/AidenRaaphorst/mc-mod-updater/releases) and download the exe file.  
When opening the file, you may get a Microsoft Defender SmartScreen pop-up, this is because I don't have money to buy a license, just click 'More info' and 'Run anyway'.

For Linux and macOS, download the source code, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` and open `main.py`.

The first time you use the app, it will ask for a CurseForge API key.  
To get one, visit https://console.curseforge.com/, login or make an account, 
click on the tab called 'API keys' and copy the key.

## Usage
1. Put the URLs of the mods you want to update in the textbox.
2. Type the version that you want to update to.
3. Change the default settings, if needed.
4. Press the search button.
5. Confirm that the mods the program found are correct.
6. Press the download button, and wait until all the mods are downloaded.  
This can take some time and the program might freeze, just be patient.
